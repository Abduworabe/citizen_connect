# 3. **Core Features of the System**

### ✔ **1. Citizen Request Submission**

A citizen opens the app or website and fills in a simple form:

* Title (e.g., “Broken water pipe”)
* Description
* Category (road, water, garbage, streetlight, etc.)
* Exact location on a map
* Upload one or more pictures
* Contact info (phone, email)

After submitting:

* A unique request ID is created
* The system marks it as **Pending**
* Citizen receives confirmation
* The request is visible to admin

---

### ✔ **2. Request Status Tracking**

Every request passes through a workflow:

1. **Pending**
   Citizen just submitted and waiting for admin review.

2. **Assigned**
   Admin assigns it to a worker or a department.

3. **In Progress**
   Employee is working on the issue.

4. **Completed**
   Work finished and proof uploaded.

5. **Closed**
   Citizen approves the completion.

6. **Rejected**
   If the request is invalid or out of the municipality's scope.

Each change generates a **notification** for the citizen.

### ✔ **3. Location Mapping (GIS Support)**

Each request includes:

* GPS coordinates
* Map pin placement
* Option for citizen to manually drag the pin

# 4. **How the System Fits Into Your Existing Structure**

You mentioned:

* **Users table already exists**
* **Places table can be replaced with Requests**

Here’s how it fits:

### Users

* Citizens → existing user role
* Employees → same user table, different role
* Admin → same user table, admin role

### Requests (replaces Places)

Instead of storing locations for "places," you store:

* Request details
* Location
* Images
* Status
* Assigned employee

### Add New Tables (Descriptions only, not code)

1. **Departments**
   For grouping employees and routing requests.

2. **Categories**
   For classifying problems.

3. **Notifications**
   To store history of alerts sent to users.

4. **Audit Logs**
   For activity tracking.
